# My First Windsurf Project: Solitaire

This project represents my first venture into AI-assisted coding using Windsurf, the world's first agentic IDE. I wanted to test out the capabilities of Cascade (Windsurf's AI coding assistant) by creating something fun and familiar - a classic game of Solitaire.

## Project Background

As someone exploring AI-assisted development, I decided to use this project as my "Hello World" equivalent. Instead of writing code manually, I collaborated with Cascade to create a fully functional Solitaire game with a modern, minimalist design.

## Features

- Clean, minimalist UI with a gradient background
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Drag and drop functionality
- Responsive card layout
- Modern color scheme
- Restart game functionality

## Technical Stack

The game is built using:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern features like CSS variables and animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no external dependencies)

## Learning Experience

This project served as an excellent introduction to:
1. Working with an AI coding assistant
2. Understanding how to effectively communicate design preferences
3. Experiencing real-time code generation and refinement
4. Learning about modern web development practices through AI collaboration

## Running the Game

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser to play the game.

## Acknowledgments

This project was created entirely through collaboration with Cascade, Windsurf's AI coding assistant. It stands as a testament to the capabilities of modern AI-assisted development tools and serves as my personal milestone in exploring this new paradigm of coding.
